## My process
Since it is a simple project, I initially thought of doing it with *HTML*, *CSS* and *Vanilla JS*. But I recently failed a *React* job tech interview that has a similar challenge, It was also to develop a countdown. Hence, to train my *React* skills, learn what I did wrong and such, I decided to develop this challenge with *React*. (I'm using the minimal way that I could think of React, since I was only interested on the states and hooks logic for this single component, so CRA and such seams a bit overdue).

1) I started with the HTML structure, then I added React and Babel(to be able to use JSX) links on the HTML header.

2) Then I created the app logic, in the script using React Hooks

3) Lastly, I added all the styling. I used the [haikei](https://app.haikei.app/) app to generate the svg drawings of the page.

### Built with

- HTML and CSS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) - JS compiler
- [Haikei](https://app.haikei.app/) - SVG Generator

### Continued development

I this project I saw that I have to improve and study more about svg, how they work and how to interact more with them. Also I have dificulties on making the site responsive, so I have to study and practive more responsiveness.

### Useful resources

- [Haikei](https://app.haikei.app/) - This helped me to create the SVGs of the site.
